# The Chocolate Stuff Mod

[![ContentDB](https://content.minetest.net/packages/lazerbeak12345/chocolatestuff/shields/downloads/)](https://content.minetest.net/packages/lazerbeak12345/chocolatestuff/)

Adds edible chocolate armor and tools. Pairs well with
[the edible swords mod][the_edible_swords_mod].

When equipped, the player will eat some of their chocolate armor if their
saturation (or health in absence of a hunger mod) is below 85%. This reduces the
durability of a random armor piece.
